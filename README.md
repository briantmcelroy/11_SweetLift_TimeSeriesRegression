# 11_SweetLift_TimeSeriesRegression

## About this Project

We are interested in providing the taxi company Sweet Lift with predictive power to its taxi order demand. They wonder if a model can be built that can capture hourly fluctuations and be used to match driver demand.

This project features a classic approach to time series modeling, and demonstrates how EDA isn't just for making compelling graphs -- it's also to inform our choice of time series model.

## Running it Yourself

The Jupyter notebook is self-contained and reflects the outputs of the code contained within. If you would like to connect to your own environment and run the notebook, or make changes on your own fork of the repo, you may do so after cloning. Make sure the environment is either based in the upper-level folder to which you clone the repo, or be sure to replace the dataset file references with a direct local reference to the /datasets/ folder on your machine. 

The project relies on scikit-learn 1.5.1. Our statsmodels version is 0.14.4. The project is stable with Python 3.11.
